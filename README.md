# Bilateral Image Inpainting
> This project implements a new inpainting method that proposes convolution with a bilateral averaging kernel. Traditional  convolution-based inpainting use image information from only a space neighborhood. A more robust approach (in structure and texture preserving) of convolutionâ€“based inpainting is using information from both space and range. This implementation produces some fascinating results when it comes to structural and textural restoration of damaged regions of the image.

## Steps to follow:
- ### Clone the project repository
  - git clone https://github.com/raj-shubham/Bilateral_Image_Inpainting.git
- ### Change path in the following files:
  - Bilateral_Image_Inpainting/code/config/settings.config
    ```shell
    "master_working_directory": "/Users/mymac/Desktop/Assignments/DIP-Assignments/Project/test/Bilateral_Image_Inpainting/code/"
    "log_directory": "/Users/mymac/Desktop/Assignments/DIP-Assignments/Project/test/Bilateral_Image_Inpainting/code/config"
    
    to 
    
    "master_working_directory": "Your_Directory/Bilateral_Image_Inpainting/code/"
    "log_directory": "Your_Directory/Bilateral_Image_Inpainting/code/config"
    ```
  - Bilateral_Image_Inpainting/code/GUI/mousecallback.py
    ```shell
    master_working_path = "/Users/mymac/Desktop/Assignments/DIP-Assignments/Project/test/Bilateral_Image_Inpainting/code/"
    
    to 
    
    master_working_path = "Your_Directory/Bilateral_Image_Inpainting/code/"
    ```

## Install the required python modules used in the project (execute inside /Bilateral_Image_Inpainting):
```shell
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Compile using the following command (execute inside /Bilateral_Image_Inpainting):
```python
$ python -m compileall .
```

## Help 
```python
$ python3 mousecallback.py -h
or 
$ python3 mousecallback.py --help
```

```shell
usage: mousecallback.py [-h]
                        image_width kernel_width sigma_range sigma_domain
                        filter_itr

Performs inpainting eg. python3 mousecallback.py 20 5 10.0 0.5 2

positional arguments:
  image_width   neighbourhood range of image (type: int ; eg. 20)
  kernel_width  kernel size (odd number) (type: int ; eg. 5)
  sigma_range   variation across intensity (type: float ; eg. 10.0)
  sigma_domain  variation across distance (type: float ; eg. 0.5)
  filter_itr    iterations over damaged regions (type: int ; eg. 2)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help    show this help message and exit
```

## Execute
```python
$ python3 mousecallback.py 20 5 10.0 0.5 2
```
