# Bilateral Image Inpainting
> This project implements a new inpainting method that proposes convolution with a bilateral averaging kernel. Traditional  convolution-based inpainting use image information from only a space neighborhood. A more robust approach (in structure and texture preserving) of convolutionâ€“based inpainting is using information from both space and range. This implementation produces some fascinating results when it comes to structural and textural restoration of damaged regions of the image.

## Steps to follow:
- ### 1. Change path in the following files:
  - config/settings.config
    ```shell
    "master_working_directory": "/Users/mymac/Desktop/Assignments/DIP-Assignments/Project/test/Bilateral_Image_Inpainting/code/"
    "log_directory": "/Users/mymac/Desktop/Assignments/DIP-Assignments/Project/test/Bilateral_Image_Inpainting/code/config"
    
    to 
    
    "master_working_directory": "Your_Directory/Bilateral_Image_Inpainting/code/"
    "log_directory": "Your_Directory/Bilateral_Image_Inpainting/code/config"
    ```
  - GUI/mousecallback.py
    ```shell
    master_working_path = "/Users/mymac/Desktop/Assignments/DIP-Assignments/Project/test/Bilateral_Image_Inpainting/code/"
    
    to 
    
    master_working_path = "Your_Directory/Bilateral_Image_Inpainting/code/"
    ```

## Install the required python modules used in the project (execute inside /Bilateral_Image_Inpainting):
```shell
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Compile using the following command (execute inside /Bilateral_Image_Inpainting):
```shell
$ python -m compileall .
```
